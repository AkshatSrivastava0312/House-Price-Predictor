# House-Price-Predictor

Note : The dataset used here is not an actual dataset. It is just a collection of random values which I have generated in MS-Excel

This code on Linear Regression is my first Machine Learning Project.
I have used:-
sklearn for model preparation, fitting and prediction,
matplotlib for data visualization and,
pandas for data preporocessing
